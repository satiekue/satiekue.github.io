            <div>
              <p>
                Kona has the most expensive electricity in the United States. As
                such, air conditioning is a significant cost. Please reach out
                to Castle for the code to unlock the air conditioning keybox.
                Air conditioning is $30/day.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are using A/C, please take care that the horizontal slats
                at the base of each window are closed. The air conditioning will
                not work if the lanai door and front door are not completely
                shut. If either door is open for more than 30 seconds, the A/C
                will shut off and will not turn on for 5 minutes.

                We have a comprehensive cable package with Spectrum. There are
                televisions in the living room, master bedroom, and guest
                bedroom. Remotes are in each room.

                Feel free to use the fully equipped kitchen. Please clean and
                return all items to their original places after use. Please do
                not bring anything breakable to the pool area.
              </p>

                supplies are under the sink. Press on/off, then select mode. We
                recommend ‚ÄúAuto‚Äù, then hit start. Close the door. There should
                be a red light on the floor indicating that the washer is
                working.

                Please do not hang towels or any clothing on the lanai railings.
                Also do not leave any food out as it will attract unwanted

              Kona is a beautiful town, but even here in Keauhou, there are
              hidden gems worth exploring! These are some of our favorites.

            <h3>Cultural Heritage Walk</h3>

              Walk out of the resort, and at Kamehameha III Road turn right, and
              walk down to the beach. Continue then on Kaleiopapa St. Take the
              first right on Ehukai St. and you&apos;re at the Outrigger. It is
              a beautiful resort to explore with lovely gardens and historical
              sights.
            </p>

            <h3>Ocean Blowhole</h3>
            <p>
              - If you take the lava oceanside path located just along the ocean
              pool north along the Kanaloa resort, you&apos;ll come to the golf
              course. Continue on the coast (you are allowed to walk along the
              golf course so long as you stay off the greens.) Before you get to
              the next resort, you&apos;ll see a beautiful large blowhole
              enclosed by a lava wall. Even on calm ocean days, you can see and
              feel the waves boom!
            </p>

            <h3>Fair Wind Cruises</h3>
            <p>
              - Few places in the world can rival the snorkel experience you
              will get on a Fair Wind day cruise. Explore the gorgeous and
              historically significant Kealakekua Bay. Very walkable from our
              condo. We&apos;ve been enjoying snorkeling with the Fair Winds
              since 1982 as a family. If you&apos;re looking for a splurge for a
              day, this is it!
            </p>

            <h3>ResortPass</h3>
            <p>
              - Although a day at the ocean pool is hard to beat, if you want
              the resort experience for a day, explore the options to spend a
              day at Big Island resort. Options through
